Hijack -Build a project, post on youtube shorts, get rewards.
This uses  yt api to find uploads to a hashtag, then adds them to a postgresql db.
This is ran periodically as a cron job
read README_DB.md for help setting up the db

as a seperate app this also serves the web page for Hijack which reads from DB to share what others are working on
